# Locked Study 1 protocol artifacts

This directory is intentionally tracked by Git. It is the destination for the compact,
reviewable artifacts that define a paper experiment:

- `grouped_split_manifest.json`
- `faithfulness_subset_manifest.json`
- `locked_protocol.json`

Do not place images, predictions, checkpoints, saliency arrays or secrets here. Those belong in
the ignored local `runs/` tree and the durable GCS run prefix.

The confirmatory runner must verify these files by hash and refuse to continue when they are
missing or have changed.
